You are given the below ASP program that contains an error.

sel(A) :- e(Y,A), e(Y,B), not sel(B).
sel(A) :- e(Y,A), not e(Y,B).

Problem description: I want to write an ASP program that decides whether there is a set cover of size k for
some positive natural number k. Formally, given a set of sets S, a set cover is a subset of S′ ⊆ S such that the sets in S
and S′ cover the same set of elements, i.e. ⋃ S = ⋃ S′.
The input is a set of facts of the form e(ELEMENT, SET), indicating that the
element ELEMENT belongs to the set SET. The resulting answer set should contain
the predicate sel(SET), indicating that the set SET is part of the cover.

Input predicates: e(ELEMENT, SET)

Output predicates: sel(SET)

Instructions: Fix the error on the above program by adding, removing or modifying existing lines.
Do not add comments or code that is not necessary to fix the error.
For your answer, return a set of changelogs, containing one or more fixes to the above program.
The changelogs must be formatted with the below instructions.

Changelog format instructions : Each changelog must start with a description of its included fixes.
The changelog must then list one or more pairs of (OriginalCode, FixedCode) code snippets.
Each OriginalCode snippet must list all consecutive original lines of code that must be replaced, followed by the FixedCode snippet with all consecutive fixed lines of code that must replace the original lines of code.
In each pair, the OriginalCode and FixedCode snippets must start at the same source code line number N.
Each listed code line, in both the OriginalCode and FixedCode snippets, must be prefixed with [N] that matches the line index N in the above snippets.
If new lines are added those code line numbers should appear as [0].

After all the changelogs, you should also indicate the type of modifications included, where the types are <added>, <removed> and <modified>.
Where <added> means new lines were added with the prefix [0], <removed> means lines were removed from the original program and <modified> means lines were modified from the original program.
You should end your reply with a markdown code block containing the full fixed program with no line numbers.
