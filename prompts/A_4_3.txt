You are given the below ASP program that contains an error.

c(1..k).
1 {color(X,I) : c(I)} 1 :- v(X).             
:- color(X,I), color(Y,I), e(X,Y), c(I).

Problem description: I want to model the k-coloring problem.
Considering the colors 1..k and an undirected graph given by the edge predicate e(s,t), I want to find a color for each vertex so that no two neighbours are colored by the same color.
There are no isolated nodes.
The program should contain the predicate assign(node, color) that is true iff node is colored by color.

Input predicates: e(s,t)

Output predicates: assign(node, color)

Instructions: Fix the error on the above program by adding, removing or modifying existing lines.
Do not add comments or code that is not necessary to fix the error.
For your answer, return a set of changelogs, containing one or more fixes to the above program.
The changelogs must be formatted with the below instructions.

Changelog format instructions : Each changelog must start with a description of its included fixes.
The changelog must then list one or more pairs of (OriginalCode, FixedCode) code snippets.
Each OriginalCode snippet must list all consecutive original lines of code that must be replaced, followed by the FixedCode snippet with all consecutive fixed lines of code that must replace the original lines of code.
In each pair, the OriginalCode and FixedCode snippets must start at the same source code line number N.
Each listed code line, in both the OriginalCode and FixedCode snippets, must be prefixed with [N] that matches the line index N in the above snippets.
If new lines are added those code line numbers should appear as [0].

After all the changelogs, you should also indicate the type of modifications included, where the types are <added>, <removed> and <modified>.
Where <added> means new lines were added with the prefix [0], <removed> means lines were removed from the original program and <modified> means lines were modified from the original program.
You should end your reply with a markdown code block containing the full fixed program with no line numbers.
