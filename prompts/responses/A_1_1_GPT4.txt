ChangeLog: 1
FixDescription: Corrected the rule to ensure no two neighbors are assigned the same color. An additional constraint is added to make sure each node is only assigned one color.
OriginalCode@1-1:
[1] :- e(A,B), assign(A, C), assign(B, C).
FixedCode@1-1:
[1] :- e(A,B), assign(A, C), assign(B, C), C != D.
[0] :- e(A,B), assign(A, C), assign(B, C), C = D.

OriginalCode@2-2:
[2] { assign(A,1..k) } = 1 :- e(A,_).
FixedCode@2-2:
[2] 1 { assign(A,1..k) } 1 :- e(A,_).

Type: <modified> <added>

```
:- e(A,B), assign(A, C), assign(B, C), C = D.
1 { assign(A,1..k) } 1 :- e(A,_).
:- e(A,B), assign(A, C), assign(B, C), C != D.
```

The revised program now correctly implements the k-coloring problem. It ensures that each node is assigned exactly one color and that neighboring nodes do not share the same color.
