ChangeLog: 1
FixDescription: Corrected the model for representing edges in the graph. In the original code, the edge relation was not well-defined as it did not consider the symmetry in edges (i.e., edge(X, Y) and edge(Y, X) are essentially the same in an undirected graph). The revised code includes additional rules to account for this symmetry, ensuring that the constraint applies correctly to prevent adjacent nodes from having the same color.

OriginalCode@3-3:
\[3\] :- assign(X,I), assign(Y,I), edge(X,Y), color(I).

FixedCode@3-3:
\[3\] :- assign(X,I), assign(Y,I), (edge(X,Y) ; edge(Y,X)), color(I).

color(1..k).                                           
1 {assign(X,I) : color(I)} 1 :- node(X).             
:- assign(X,I), assign(Y,I), (edge(X,Y) ; edge(Y,X)), color(I).
