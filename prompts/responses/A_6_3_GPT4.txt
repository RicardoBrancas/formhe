FixDescription: Modified the program to correctly model the k-coloring problem by ensuring that each edge has different colors for its connected nodes. The error was in the rule that checked whether two connected nodes had the same color. Instead of using the edge predicate directly, itâ€™s better to ensure both ways of an edge are checked since the graph is undirected.
OriginalCode@4-4:
[4] :- e(N, M), assign(N,C), assign(M,C).
FixedCode@4-4:
[4] :- e(N, M), assign(N,C), assign(M,C).
[0] :- e(M, N), assign(N,C), assign(M,C).
