FixDescription: Modified the conflict rule to ensure that no two adjacent nodes have the same color. The initial rule wasnâ€™t handling the bidirectional nature of the edges properly.
OriginalCode@3-3:
[3] :- assign(N, C), assign(A, C), e(N,A).
FixedCode@3-3:
[3] :- assign(N, C), assign(A, C), (e(N, A) ; e(A, N)).

Type: <modified>

```
1 { assign(N, C) : k(C) } 1 :- e(_, N).
1 { assign(N, C) : k(C) } 1 :- e(N, _).
:- assign(N, C), assign(A, C), (e(N, A) ; e(A, N)).
