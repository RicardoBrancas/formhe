ChangeLog: 1
FixDescription: Corrected the constraint that ensures no two neighbors have the same color. The original code used a condition that was not correctly ensuring this constraint, and I modified it to correctly compare the colors of the nodes that share an edge.
OriginalCode@4-4:
[4] :- assign(N, C), assign(A, C), C==C1, e(N,A).
FixedCode@4-4:
[4] :- assign(N, C), assign(A, C), e(N,A).

Type: <modified>

```
k(1..n).
1 { assign(N, C) : k(C) } 1 :- e(_, N).
1 { assign(N, C) : k(C) } 1 :- e(N, _).
:- assign(N, C), assign(A, C), e(N,A).
```
