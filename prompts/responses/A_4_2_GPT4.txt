FixDescription: Ensure that each node is assigned exactly one color, and that neighboring nodes do not share the same color.
OriginalCode@1-1:
[1] { assign(X,1..k) } = 1 :- node(X).
FixedCode@1-1:
[1] 1 { assign(X,1..k) } 1 :- node(X).
[0] :- e(X,Y), assign(X,C), assign(Y,C).

Type: <modified> <added>

```
1 { assign(X,1..k) } 1 :- node(X).
:- e(X,Y), assign(X,C), assign(Y,C).
```

Explanation:
- I modified the rule to ensure each node is assigned exactly one color by enforcing that exactly one color is picked for each node.
- I added a constraint to ensure that no two adjacent nodes share the same color. This is done by adding a rule that becomes unsatisfiable if there exist edges where both nodes are assigned the same color.
