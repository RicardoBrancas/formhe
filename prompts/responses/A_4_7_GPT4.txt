ChangeLog: 1
FixDescription: Corrected the representation of the coloring predicate to match the problem's requirement and also renamed the predicate to "assign" as per the output predicate requirement. Modified the rules to ensure each vertex gets a color that no neighboring vertex shares.
OriginalCode@2-2:
[2] 1 {color(X,I) : c(I)} 1 :- v(X).
FixedCode@2-2:
[2] 1 {assign(X,I) : c(I)} 1 :- v(X).

OriginalCode@3-3:
[3] :- color(X,I), color(Y,I), e(X,Y), c(I).
FixedCode@3-3:
[3] :- assign(X,I), assign(Y,I), e(X,Y), c(I).
