ChangeLog: 1
FixDescription: Modified the constraints to correctly express that no two neighbors should have the same color and also added a rule to ensure that every node is assigned at least one color. 
OriginalCode@2-2:
[2] :- e(X,Y), assign(X,C), assign(Y,C).
FixedCode@2-2:
[2] :- e(X,Y), assign(X,C), assign(Y,C), X != Y.

OriginalCode@1-1:
[1] 1{assign(X:Y,1..k)}1 :- e(X,Y).
FixedCode@1-1:
[1] 1{assign(X,1..k)}1 :- e(X,_).
[1] 1{assign(Y,1..k)}1 :- e(_,Y).

Type: <modified> <added>
