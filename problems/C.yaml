title: Set Cover
description: >-
  Given a set of sets S, a set cover is a subset S′ ⊆ S such that the sets in S
  and S′ cover the same set of elements, i.e. ∪ S = ∪ S′.
  Write an ASP program that decides whether there is a set cover of size `k` for
  some positive natural number `k`.

  The input is a set of facts of the form `e(ELEMENT, SET)`, indicating that the
  element `ELEMENT` belongs to the set `SET`. The resulting answer set should contain
  the predicate `sel(SET)`, indicating that the set SET is part of the cover. Do not
  include the definition for k or the example sets in your solution file.

inputs:
  - |
    #const k = 2.
    e(1, a). e(2, a). e(3, a). e(2, b). e(4, b). e(4, c). e(5, c).
  - |
    #const k = 2.
    e(1, a). e(2, a). e(3, a). e(2, b). e(4, b). e(3, c). e(4, c). e(4, d). e(5, d).
