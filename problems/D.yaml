title: Vertex Cover
description: >-
  Given an undirected graph G = (V, E), a vertex cover is a set of vertices V′ ⊆ V
  such that each edge e ∈ E is incident with at least one vertex in V′, i.e. if
  e = (v1, v2), it must be that v1 ∈ V′ or v2 ∈ V′.
  Write an Answer Set program P that finds a vertex cover of limited size. The
  input is a concrete graph and a natural number k.

  The edges are specified by
  a predicate `e(X,Y)`. The program should contain a predicate `sel(X)`, which
  is true if and only if the vertex X is part of the vertex cover. Assume that `k` is
  a natural number defining the upper bound on the size of the vertex cover. Do
  not include the definition for k or the example graph in your solution file.

inputs:
  - |
    #const k = 3.
    e(1, 2). e(1, 3). e(4, 3). e(4, 5).
  - |
    #const k = 2.
    e(1, 2). e(1, 3). e(4, 3). e(4, 5).
  - |
    #const k = 3.
    e(1, 2). e(2, 3). e(3, 4). e(4, 5). e(5, 6).
  - |
    #const k = 1.
    e(1, 3). e(2, 3).
  - |
    #const k = 3.
    e(1, 2).
